# CompetitiveProgramming

A curated collection of competitive programming solutions and practice problems, spanning platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and GeeksforGeeks. This repository is organized to make it easy to browse problems by ID, revisit fundamental algorithms, and track learning progress.

## ✨ What’s Inside

- **Problem-by-problem directories** (e.g., `0001-two-sum`, `0005-longest-palindromic-substring`) containing:
  - Problem statements in `README.md`
  - Solution implementations (language varies by problem)
- **Standalone practice scripts** for algorithms and Python fundamentals (e.g., sorting, string handling, set operations).
- **Training folders** that group content by learning phase (e.g., `firstPhase`, `onboarding`, `camp`, `week4`).

## 📁 Repository Structure

Examples of what you’ll find:

- `0001-two-sum/`, `0005-longest-palindromic-substring/`, `0011-container-with-most-water/` …  
  LeetCode problem folders with statements and solutions.
- `Check if array is sorted - GFG/`  
  Problem folder for GeeksforGeeks.
- `CountingSort1.py`, `bubbleSort.py`, `insertionSort1.py`  
  Sorting implementations and related practice.
- `addBinary.py`, `longestPrefix.py`, `palindromeString.py`  
  String and array utilities.

> The directory names typically follow the problem ID + title format for quick lookup.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays and strings
- Two pointers
- Sorting and searching
- Hashing
- Bit manipulation
- Basic math and number theory
- Python language practice (I/O, control flow, collections)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Browse by problem number**  
   Each problem directory contains its description and solutions.
2. **Run a script locally**  
   Most solutions are plain Python scripts and can be run directly:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
3. **Practice & iterate**  
   Add new solutions or refine existing ones as you learn.

## ✅ Contributing (Personal Workflow)

If you’re using this as a personal study repo, consider this workflow:

- Add a new folder named like `XXXX-problem-title`
- Include:
  - `README.md` with the problem statement
  - One or more solution files
- Commit with a message like:  
  `Add solution for XXXX - Problem Title`

## 📌 Notes

- Solutions are written with clarity and practice in mind.
- You may find multiple approaches for the same problem over time.
- This repo is meant for learning and revision, not necessarily optimized production code.
